# tutor-excel


### DEMO

You can access a live demo of the Tutor Excel website [here](https://tutor-excel.vercel.app/). Feel free to explore and use the platform.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd tutor-excel
    ```
3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command. This will open the application in your default browser, and it will automatically reload when you make changes to the source code.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally to preview it before deploying.

## Deployment

To deploy this project, you first need to build it:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with all the static files needed for deployment. You can then deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
